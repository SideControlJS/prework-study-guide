# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation to create this wepage is because it is related to schoolwork and I to learn the basics of creating a functional webpage, so this is a study guide to track my progress! I created a study guide because I need a place to track all of my notes for this course; what better way than to incorporate building a functional webpage while also being a way to capture notes for my course. This wepage solves the problem of not having a single place to store and access all of my coursework study material. During the process of creating this webpage, I have learned many things. The topic that I learned most about was git version control. I ran into a few hiccups with git version control, but by researching, thinking, and trying different methods I was able to 'debug' my issues! I have learned that creating a functional webpage incorporates many skills and technologies!

This Prework Study Guide has sections for each main subject, like HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, and each section has notes associated with its subject.

Once you're on the webpage, you can use Chrome Dev Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I) in order to see the JavaScript that is running. The JavaScript will list the topics that I learn from Prework and choose one topic for me to study first.
